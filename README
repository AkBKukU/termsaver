TermSaver
=========

*A simple text-based screensaver for terminal windows.*

Background
----------

The motivation behind this project is basically pure boredom (laughs). 
Seriously, it may look like nonsense to have a screensaver look-alike program
running on a terminal window. Nonetheless, sometimes, we still want to see some
kind of movement, or action on the screen... which invigorates one's state of
mind and helps concentration back to the black screen (well, some people like 
it white, meh!).

If you are:

  * looking for some extra display on your main terminal window, to keep the 
    screen busy while you are up to something else; or
  * looking for some distractions that may entertain you after too many hours
    in front of the terminal; or
  * with plenty of screen space (so long 80x25 default terminal window! long 
    live 1920px...), and use many terminals on screen; or
  * just wanting to pretend you are busy with something (this is terrible)

then, TermSaver is the **right** application for you.


Requirements
------------

  * Linux, or Mac
  * Python 2.4+ (and < 3.x)

**Note**: Windows support is in the roadmap.


Installation
------------

For those without the time or patience to scan through the rest of this 
document, here is the installation procedure, plain and simple:

1. Download the Source 
[here](https://github.com/brunobraga/termsaver/downloads)
2. Unpack it
     
        tar -zxvf termsaver-{version}.tar.gz

3. Install it

        sudo python setup.py install 

4. All done! 


Features
--------

The TermSaver is a very simple application, built with the idea to allow more 
screensavers to be added to its core. Developers, please read the section below. 

The current published screensavers are:

>#### Ascii Art Farts
>
>This is a screensaver that displays ascii art from asciiartfarts.com 
>RSS feed in an animation format. 
>
>A video showing this screensaver in action will be uploaded shortly.
>
>#### Dot
>
>A extremely simple screensaver, created more with the idea to guide developers 
>on how to use the termsaver libraries to build their own, and help grow the 
>termsaver screensaver gallery in future.
>
>This screensaver only displays a running dot that appears in random locations 
>and sizes.
>
>A video showing this screensaver in action will be uploaded shortly.
>
>#### Jokes For All
>
>This is a screensaver that displays recent jokes from <http://jokes4all.net>
>website, from its hourly updated [RSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) feed.
>
>A video showing this screensaver in action will be uploaded shortly.
>
>#### Programmer
>
>This is a screensaver that displays source code from a specified path in
>visual animation.
>
>A video showing this screensaver in action will be uploaded shortly.
>
>#### Quotes For All
>
>This is a screensaver that displays recent quotes from <http://quotes4all.net>
>website, from its hourly updated [RSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) feed.
>
>A video showing this screensaver in action will be uploaded shortly.
>
>#### Random Text
>
>This is a screensaver that displays a text (your name, or whatever) on a 
> randomized position of the screen, changing position every N seconds.
>
>A video showing this screensaver in action will be uploaded shortly.
>
>#### Request for Change
>
>This is a screensaver that fetches documents from RFC (Request for Comments)
>in visual animation, which are documents elaborated by the  Internet 
>Engineering Task Force, available at <http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/>. This 
>screensaver randomizes documents to display, from a list of latest valid
>documents. See more information about this in 
>[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments).
>
>A video showing this screensaver in action will be uploaded shortly.
>
>#### RSS Feeds
>
>This is a screensaver that displays any 
>[RSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) feed you want to show in your
>terminal, with customizable settings and format.
>
>A video showing this screensaver in action will be uploaded shortly.
>
>#### URL Fetcher
>
>This is a screensaver that displays content from a specified 
>[URL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_resource_locator) directly
>on screen, in visual animation.
>
>A video showing this screensaver in action will be uploaded shortly.

Developers
----------

A more detailed guideline for developers willing to jump in and create 
screensavers for termsaver will be available soon.


Roadmap
-------

A complete description of a 
[TODO](https://github.com/brunobraga/termsaver/blob/master/TODO) 
list can be found in the source code itself, or within the 
[Issues](https://github.com/brunobraga/termsaver/issues) tab in GitHub.

A sneak peak of what is in our mind:

>#### Keyboard events
>For example, to allow the app to run in background and start the foreground
>if idle for N minutes. Then, it would be back by any keyboard action.
>
>#### i18n
>Just support to many languages to help spread the word! 
>Work in progress.
>
>#### Digital Clock
>build a screen to draw ascii based numbers and display time, as a clock.
>
>#### Windows Support
>Python is cross-platform, but there are tricks to make this work in the
>rudimentary DOS screen. Work in progress.

### Translation

The internationalization of this application follows same standards of most
applications out there, by using *gettext* and MO/PO files.

The translation is still being finished up, and when it is ready for 
contributor calls, we will post detailed information about the procedure.

Let us know you want to help: <support@termsaver.info>


### Screensavers (plugin)

As of this moment, all screensavers are part of the termsaver library, but it
was initially designed to predict the implementation of additional screensavers
as plug-ins to the main application. 

This is, however, not fully defined, so feel free to start now by forking this
code and implementing it directly inside termsaver. Your contribution will be
reflected in the list of authors of this application.


### Submit a bug

If you find any errors in this application, you are more than welcome to 
participate. You can:

* report the bug: <https://github.com/brunobraga/termsaver/issues>

* Fork this project: <https://github.com/brunobraga/termsaver/fork>
    
Uninstall
----------

To uninstall termsaver, you will need to run some additional commands:

    # Step 1 - re-install creating a manifest file
    sudo python setup.py install --record /tmp/termsaver.install.record.txt

    # Step 2 - uninstall referencing the manifest file
    sudo python setup.py uninstall --manifest /tmp/termsaver.install.record.txt
